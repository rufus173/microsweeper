# Requirements

Built off ncurses, hence install `libncurses-dev`

# Installation

`make microsweeper`
`sudo make install`

# About

This was just a game I thought I would make to use, as a couldn't find a good non sketchy version of minesweeper for the terminal.

## How to use

pretty simple. use 'e' to place a flag ('P' symbol). use `<enter>` to dig.

## Current issues

I am currently working on these issues

 - doesnt show mines after failure
 - doesnt colour any of the numbers making it harder to see
